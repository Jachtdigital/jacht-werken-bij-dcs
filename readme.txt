Job vacancies management for WordPress websites.

== Description ==

= Vacancies Management =

This plugin provides a comprehensive job vacancy management system for WordPress. Vacancies can be created and managed directly within WordPress, with support for multiple languages through Polylang integration.

= Rich Snippets =

We provide the foundation of rich snippets on the single job listing page based on JobPosting. These can be customized or supplemented using the \'rec_structured_data\' filter.

= Labels and slug =

Change the labels of the CPT based on the following filters. Plural/title \'rec_cpt_title\', by default this is \'Vacatures\' (Vacancies), singular through \'rec_cpt_single\', with the default being \'Vacature\' (Vacancy). Additionally, you can also change the slug of the vacancies using \'rec_cpt_slug\', the default slug is \'jobs\'.

= Examples =

Within the \"Examples\" folder, there are three files that can be used to support the formatting of archive and single pages within WordPress. Additionally, there is an extra file containing useful helper functions for extracting the data.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Ensure Advanced Custom Fields Pro is installed and activated.
